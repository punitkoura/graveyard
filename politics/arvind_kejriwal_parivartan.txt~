Arvind Kejriwal as a part of NGO Parivartan (in year 2002) when no one knew about him.

In this video, he initially talks about taxes. He says that all the people of India, from the poorest to the richest, pay taxes. But then if we pay taxes, who is the real owner of the tax? Of course, we are. Government officials are servants, and we are the masters. This is the essence of Democracy. Govt. of the people, for the people, and by the people.

Tell me. Do you know how your taxes are being utilized? Do you know how the Government Servants are taking money out of our treasury for their personal gains. The truth is that we never bothered to ask. We have been in slumber for more than 60 years. But now we must wake up to the harsh reality.

Back to the video. The video then tries to explain via a street play how the money the people of Seemapuri and Sundar Nagri was being utilized by the Government.

The people decided to ask the Government servants themselves about how their tax money had been spent on 14.12.2002
